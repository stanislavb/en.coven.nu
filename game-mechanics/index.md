## Meta-techniques

These are ways in which we can communicate between players in-game without having to stop the game completely and break character. As a player if you see or hear these techniques and they are not being directed to you personally, you most often ignore them, they do not exist in the in-game world.

There are different interpretations of all meta-techniques depending on the country or even the community they are being used in. Because of this please read our interpretations carefully even if you feel you are already familiar with these techniques. These are the versions we will use at our LARP.

## The Powers

Almost everything to do with using and receiving your powers will involve meta techniques.

The beads we use to symbolise the powers are “invisible” ingame as are the letters you receive when new powers are lotted out. They are a reminders for you and other players of which powers that exists and who has them.

When you use your powers, take Mortis for example, you must use the words “Alma, Mortis” in order for the other player to know what is now expected of them. This phrase does not exist IN, your character doesn’t actually say it, only you as the player. Alma is a meta keyword to catch the other players attention and make them aware that they need to listen to what you are about to say. 

It is also an OFF indicator that your character is actively trying to use their power. You can also play on your character using their powers by accident or trying and failing. If you say “Mortis” without using Alma first it is up to the other player if it has any effect at all or if it failed completely, they also choose whether their character noticed your characters attempt or not.

## The Lottery System

Each player will begin with one to three out of the five powers. During the game the players can communicate with a member of the household about receiving a new power. The lotto system consists of pulling a coloured bead out of a bag; each power is represented by a colour. Once a new power has been chosen the player receives an envelope in the colour of their new power containing a short text with a memory of the power and a reminder of how the power works in game. 

The bead is an IN symbol to other players of what powers you have. They can be on either a necklace or a bracelet but should be visible to other players at all times.

The new power does not have to be played on straight away. The player can even choose to open the letter at a later time. The letters are a meta-technique and are not visible to other players. They can however be left out openly to allow other players to "sense" or "suspect" a new power is developing or to simply remind others of what powers you have. The power should not be played on however, by other players, whether they can see that letter is opened or not. It is not until the bead is placed on the necklace or bracelet that the player has put their new power into play.

A player can choose to receive no new powers at all or all five powers, at any pace they choose. You must have at least three powers by the afternoon of the second day if you wish to enter into The Seven Wonders.
