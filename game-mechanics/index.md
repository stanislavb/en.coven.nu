## Meta-techniques

These are ways in which we can communicate between players in-game without having to stop the game completely and break character. As a player if you see or hear these techniques and they are not being directed to you personally, you most often ignore them, they do not exist in the in-game world.

There are different interpretations of all meta-techniques depending on the country or even the community they are being used in. Because of this please read our interpretations carefully even if you feel you are already familiar with these techniques. These are the versions we will use at our LARP.

## The Powers

to be translated

## The Lottery System

Each player will begin with one to three out of the five powers. During the game the players can communicate with a member of the household about receiving a new power. The lotto system consists of pulling a coloured bead out of a bag; each power is represented by a colour. Once a new power has been chosen the player receives an envelope in the colour of their new power containing a short text with a memory of the power and a reminder of how the power works in game. 

The bead is an IN symbol to other players of what powers you have. They can be on either a necklace or a bracelet but should be visible to other players at all times.

The new power does not have to be played on straight away. The player can even choose to open the letter at a later time. The letters are a meta-technique and are not visible to other players. They can however be left out openly to allow other players to "sense" or "suspect" a new power is developing or to simply remind others of what powers you have. The power should not be played on however, by other players, whether they can see that letter is opened or not. It is not until the bead is placed on the necklace or bracelet that the player has put their new power into play.

A player can choose to receive no new powers at all or all five powers, at any pace they choose. You must have at least three powers by the afternoon of the second day if you wish to enter into The Seven Wonders.
