There are different definitions of what a Game-Mechanic is and what a Meta-Technique is. When we talk about game-mechanics for this LARP we will use it describe the interactive mechanics the player must use in order to achieve something in-game: i.e. the lottery system used to gain new powers. We will also use it as an umbrella term to describe all of the following.

## Meta-techniques

These are ways in which we can communicate between players in-game without having to stop the game completely and break character. As a player if you see or hear these techniques and they are not being directed at you personally: you most often ignore them. They do not exist in the in-game world. The words used when casting our powers are an example of a meta-technique, as are the beads you will wear to show other players which powers you have.

## The Powers

Almost everything to do with using and receiving your powers will involve meta-techniques.
The colour coded beads we use to symbolise the powers, for example, are “invisible” in-game. As are the letters you receive when your new power is lotted out. They are a reminders for you and other players of which powers that exists and who has them.

When you use your powers, take Mortis for example, you must use the words “Alma, Mortis” in order for the other player to know what is now expected of them. This phrase does not exist IN, your character doesn’t actually say it, only you the player. “Alma, Mortis” is a meta-technique to catch the other players attention and make them aware that they need to listen to what you are about to say.

“Alma, Mortis” is also an OFF indicator that your character is actively trying to use their power. This also allows you to play on your character using their powers by accident or trying and failing: if you say “Mortis” without using Alma first it is up to the other player if it has any effect at all or if it has failed completely. They can also choose whether their character noticed your characters attempt to use mortis on them or not.

The meta words for the powers:

“Alma, Mortis”: for the touch of death.  
“Alma, Vitalis”: to resurrect the dead or heal the living.  
“Alma, Concilium”: for mind control.  
“Alma, Clarvoyance”: for mind reading.  
“Alma, Transfero”: to transfer your injury or emotions to another.  

For more information on the five powers look under Fiction.

## The Lottery System

Each player will begin the LARP with one, two or three out of the five powers. During the game the players can at any time talk with a member of the household about receiving a new power. 

The lottery system consists of pulling a coloured bead at random out of a bag: each power is represented by a colour. The beads are an OFF reminder to others of what powers you have. They can be placed on either a necklace or a bracelet but should be visible to other players at all times. 

The player also receives an envelope in the colour of their new power with a reminder of how it works in-game. The new power does not have to be played on straight away. It is not until the bead is placed on the necklace or bracelet that the player has put their new power into play.

These letters are also OFF. They can however be left out openly to allow other players to “sense” or “suspect” a new power is developing; or to simply remind others of what powers you have. But do not play on the new power until you see that the player in question has “put it into play” by placing the bead on their necklace/bracelet.

A player can choose to receive no new powers at all during the LARP, or all five powers in the first day. The player chooses their own pace based on the story they want to create for their character. 

In order to participate in the Seven Trials you must have at least four powers by Saturday afternoon.

## Fuck, Easy and Tap Out

Escalation:

If you wish to escalate a scene during the game you can signal this desire to the other player by using the word “Fuck” by itself or in a sentence. I.e. “No, I won’t go with you. Fuck off!” is an invitation to the other player. It is always a good idea to also show what kind of escalation you mean when you extend the invitation. 

For example, if two players are having a fight and this has involved only shouting, but one player feels that it would be a good idea to become more physical this player could gently push the other player. Use the invitation to escalate play and await the reply before continuing.

The other player can now signal that they accept this offer or invitation to escalate by replying with “Fuck”. I.e. “Yes, you fucking are!” would be a possible reply to show that the escalation is accepted. 

De-escalation:

If a player does not want the scene to escalate but are comfortable continuing the scene at the level they currently are at they can use the de-escalation word “Easy”. I.e. “Ok, take it easy!”. This turns down the invitation to escalate but does not end the scene. 

In the previous example this would mean that the player is comfortable with the shouting but does not want any physical play at this time.

The de-escalation word is not only used as a reply to an escalation request. If a player wants a scene to calm down, but not to end completely, they can inform the other player/s of this by using “Easy”. 

Tap Out:

Sometimes we just don’t want a certain type of play or a scene gets too much for us and we want out fast. This doesn’t always mean that we want or need to go OFF. This is when we can use “Tap, Tap” you either physically tap the player twice, or more if they do not notice at first. You can also say “Tap, tap” to the player. This means stop what you are doing or about to do and let’s leave this scene now. 

If a player uses “Tap, tap” with you: first stop what you are doing. Now comes common sense, have you just done an intense scene together or do you know that the player has just come from an intense scene? Do they look distressed? Overtired? Hungry? Even though the player used “Tap,tap” not “OFF”; if you are in any way unsure about their well being, take a minute to go OFF. Ask them if they are alright and if they need anything from you. We would much rather that you break immersion for two seconds to check if a person is ok, then ignore potential signs out of fear of breaking immersion for other players. 

OFF:

OFF is always OFF. You break the game or scene and discuss the problem. If a player uses “OFF” with you, listen to what they have to say. Ask them what they need from you. Help them get to a safety host if necessary.
