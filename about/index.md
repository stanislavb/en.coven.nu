## Vision

Coven takes place in a newly, rather unwillingly, formed coven of witches: present day, Sweden. It's about cool powers; the witches that wield them, and the people trying to kill them for it. 

A chance to: indulge in highschool clichés, make friends, be betrayed, fall in love, accidentaly kill someone and desperately try to ressurect them before the Surpreme Witch finds out...or simply cover your tracks. 

The mood is tense. The future is unsure, and you have either way too little power or too much to be in control. You have to make friends. You have to trust. You have to help each other or you'll most probably die one day soon, far too soon for your taste. 

But first you have to work out where the biggest threat lies: outside your soven or within it?

## History

Witches have always existed, but they have mostly kept to themselves and avoided discovery by the outside world. They existed in covens, a group of witches bonded together in a specific place. These covens have been their home, refuge and community. 

Witch hunters have always existed. Under the cover of large organizations they have tracked and killed witches for generations. Over the last thirty years they have suceeded in exterminating coven after coven. The few covens that remain are in hiding and many witches have renounced their powers and assimilated into the rest of society. The few Covens remaining are mostly resigned to their fate since they have nowhere else to go. Even their greatest authority, the Witches' Council, seemed to have given up. 

Then suddenly something changed. Witch hunters stopped focusing on covens as their main target and started going after individual witches. At first previous coven members, but then they started targeting anyone with magical potential, even before many of them were aware of their own power. The Witches' Council was forced to step in; rescuing young witches and sending them to the few covens still undiscovered by the witch hunters. 

This is the situation now. Newly rescued witches arrive at a Swedish coven to discover and learn to deal with their powers, each other, and the life threatening danger they all face.

## Inspiration

The fiction is mostly inspired by the show "American Horror Story: Coven". You can watch this is if you want, but it is far from neccessary in order to participate in the LARP. The sexism, racism and cultural appropriation has been removed as thoroughly as we can. 

Another inspiration is the Swedish book "Cirkeln". Read or watch this if you want more of an insight the types of tropes we will be using in our character creation. It is also a lot more similar to the mood we are trying to achieve.

## Too much information

This LARP uses transparency with its players as much as possible to ensure that they can plan their own narrative accordingly. There will also be times where, depending on the players actions IN game, they will be required to go OFF with the organizers to plan scenes.

Things to learn will be kept to a minimum so that the players can focus on enjoying and exploring the LARP. There will however be some game-mechanics and meta-techniques which the players will be required to learn in order to participate. These will be drilled as much as possible at the preLARP workshop, but since the LARP is designed so that players have almost nothing else to learn or prepare, you will be expected to show up already reasonably proficient. All the neccessary information will be availiable on this site.

Being confident with the techniques the LARP uses will allow the players to have fun with their powers and use them to create great moments for themselves and others; invent rituals, tease each other, defend yourself and really immerse in the world.

## Safety

There will be members of the Household moving about the area during the LARP. The Household is a mix of Helpers and Organizers and can always be pulled aside if you need to ask something or report a problem. 

Any problems you bring to the Household will be taken seriously, and we will attempt to deal with any problems, questions or requests as swiftly as possible. Problems involving other players will always be dealt with as a team and no indiviual member of the Household will be taking major safety decisions alone. This however does not include cases where patricipants are in direct danger; such as fire or violence. 

All players have signed a participant contract and any player who breaks this agreement will be asked to leave. To read the participant contract look under Practical.

The LARP will use the Red, Green, Yellow system and the Ping-Pong system for safe play and a system for sex is being decided upon. To read more about these techniques go to Game Mechanics.
