## The Supreme

The Supreme Witch is the head of the coven; each coven has their own Supreme. 

To become the Supreme of a coven you must pass the trial of The Seven Wonders. This means that the Supreme has proven themselves able to use all seven powers. Only one Supreme exists in each coven generation and you only take the trial once in your life, if at all. However this activation of a Supreme only occurs in covens of thirteen and above; meaning that a coven with less witches will not receive a new Supreme and often die out. This is the case for the Dahlin Coven, which only has an acting Supreme serving in the role as Scout Mistress.

The Supreme is not just the Coven leader; their attitude, morals and ethics affects the whole Coven and can make it stronger or weaker, righteous or criminal. The Supremes only answers to The Witchâ€™s Council.

*There will be one acting Supreme at the Dahlin Coven. This role will have additional responsibilities during the larp and be responsible for holding some lessons. This role will be casted.*

## The Seconds

The Seconds are the highest ranking witches under the Supreme. They are most often the other top candidates from the trial where the reigning Supreme was chosen. They assist the Supreme and are her right hand in all manners concerning the Coven. Like the Supreme, the Seconds have a huge influence on the coven; usually in charge of teaching the other witches they enforce the traditions, morals and ethics of the Supreme. And, at their own risk, maybe even try to push their own.

*There are two Seconds at the Dahlin Coven. These roles will have additional responsibilities during the larp and be responsible for holding some lessons. These roles will be casted.*

## The Witches

Witches develop their first power around puberty. Mishaps which foreshadow a later power have however been known to occur earlier; suggesting that the power is dormant in the body until puberty activates it. It is not unusual for it to be very weak in the beginning or to mutate into a more powerful form as the witch grows. So unless the power is particularly strong or traumatic, most witches only start to become aware of their own power in their late teens. At that point a second power might even have begun developing.

Most witches only ever develop one to three powers; normally each one is consecutively weaker. A good coven helps a young witch to steer, amplify and even develop new powers. Without a coven the powers can be hard to control or to understand at all. 

Once initiated into a coven you belong to it until you die, even if you leave you are still seen as answerable to your Supreme. The only exception being if your Supreme has died and your coven has ceased to be. In these times most witches that do not want to integrate into society, but have been left covenless, join together and try to form a new coven or join with a dying coven and try to revive it. 

There exists a strict hierarchy within a coven. Even though only the Supreme and the Seconds receive an official title the timing which you entered a coven is reflected in your status. New arrivals are often referred to as juniors and the older members are their seniors. Disrespecting the hierarchy can have dire consequences. Seconds usually leave punishment of juniors up to the seniors.

*The majority of roles at this larp will be juniors, newly arrived. Some will be seniors and these roles will have some additional responsibilities. Some of the seniors will be casted, all the juniors will be lotted.*

## The Household

The household includes the cooks and the staff. Most of them have been a part of the Dahlin household for many years. 

*The household is made up of the organizers and their assistants.*

## Friends & Family

In your character description you will find that some of the people in your characters life may have been mentioned. Since the LARP is set in the present time you will be able to phone some these characters, if you wish, during the LARP. We strongly encourage you to invite people to play either these roles, or others which you feel would benefit your character. We will also have a list of available players who wish to be phone contacts during the larp.

*Friends and family are played by people you invite yourself or that have been provided by us at your request.*

## The Witch Hunters

This is a team assembled and sent out by the Swedish branch of the witch hunters. Many of them have worked together before and they are all related somewhere down the line. The duty of hunting and exterminating witches is a family one.

*NPC group.*
