## Workshops

A half day workshop will take place the first day of the LARP. This is obligatory.  
You will be expected to have learnt the five powers before the workshop. 

The workshop will include:
* Character development
* Relationship building
* Safety techniques and key words
* Meta-techniques and Game Mechanics
* The narrative plot and time plan
* Getting into character

## What to bring with you

Juniors: As your character you have arrived at the coven the day of the LARP and will only be expected to bring minimal baggage. Overnight gear such as a toothbrush, pyjamas, towel etc is recommended and at least one change of black clothes is required. There are beds and bedding on site, you will need to bring your own bed linen however. 

Ear plugs are recommended since you will be sleeping in dorms. 

Acting Supreme, Seconds and Seniors: Your character has lived in the Dahlin Coven for at least a year. You have the same minimum gear expectations as the juniors but you may of course choose to bring more, to decorate your rooms etc. 

## Participant Contract

We the organizers promise you:

- That the information on the website, when the event and date is released, is valid.
- That there will be areas at the venue where you can go off-game, rest and feel safe.
- A thrilling larp with elements of horror and action.
- Facebook groups for social interaction before the event takes place.
- A workshop including character building, meta techniques and safe words.
- A safety host, in a set location, whom you can always reach during the larp.
- Your own sleeping place in a dorm, indoors, and three warm meals per day.

As a participant we expect of you:

- To contribute to an including and affirming atmosphere.
- To read and reflect on the information on the web site.
- To keep up-to-date about new information in the facebook group. If you donâ€™t have a facebook account, you need to create one or have regular contact with a friend who does. 
- To ask questions, if you have them. The earlier we hear of your queeries, the bigger the chance that we can do something about answering them.
- To show up at the specified check-in time.
- To respect and follow rules and instructions from organizers.
- To reflect upon and accept this simple fact: to attend a larp is like playing in an orchestra, not like going to the theatre. When you are registered and have payed your registration fee, we are counting on you. You are needed in the game and can not easily be replaced. (If an emergency occurs, contact the organizers as soon as possible).

## Safety Agreement 

- Safety and break words on this larp are Green, Yellow and Red. 
- Saying OFF is a possibility to cut the scene completely and go off-game. We encourage you to use all words if and whenever you feel they are needed during the game.
- Safety and break words are to be respected without hesitation.
- Scenes or play with a sexual under- or overtone between players need to be agreed upon in advance (with explicit consent). - You are always welcome to speak to the safety host if you feel at all unsure or unsafe.
- At this larp pushing (with open palms) and simple fastholding (hand on wrist/ancle) can occur. Gun replicas might be used as a visual display only. You are always welcome to speak to the safety host if you feel at all unsure or unsafe.
- All other play based on violence needs to be agreed upon in advance (with explicit consent). You are always welcome to speak to the safety host if you feel at all unsure or unsafe.
- Play or scenes based on sexism, racism, hbtq-phobia or able-ism is strictly forbidden.
- Participants found breaking the rules of the safety document can be asked to leave the venue and larp immediately or have their play restricted depending on the severity of the rule breaking. The final decision is made by the organizers. 
- If a fellow player brings a situation to light where they have felt insecure, violated, or in any other way mistreated: listen. Ask what the player needs from you. You may want to offer a hug (ask, then wait for consent). Help them to get to the security host.
