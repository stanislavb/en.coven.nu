## How do you normally end up in a coven?
 Once your first power appears, usually in your early teens you are sent to a coven. If you have family living within the magical community then you, or they, may have had a say in which coven you were sent to. 

Most seniors have come from families that are aware of their linage and would have expected the Council to come get you when it became clear that you were a witch.
