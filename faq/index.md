## How do you normally end up in a coven?
Once your first power appears, usually in your early teens you are sent to a coven. If you have family living within the magical community then you, or they, may have had a say in which coven you were sent to. 

Most seniors have come from families that are aware of their linage and would have expected the Council to come get you when it became clear that you were a witch.

## If your powers show up in your early teens, are the juniors less powerful since they were only picked up now?
Not necessarily. The seniors have mostly come from families that would have recognised the signs of the powers developing early on. 

Most of the juniors have had no idea that they are witches and can therefore have had their powers for years, without understanding them, before they came to the Dahlin Coven. 

## What happens to my family when I join a Coven?
Back when witches were prevalent it wasn’t unusual for a family to contain more than one witch within the same generation. Nowadays you may only have a single distant relative in a far off coven, but they are now your “family”. The family and friends you had outside of the magical community are rarely seen or spoken to again. Even your parents.

## What happens if I misbehave at the Coven?
Covens are not actually schools, although they do teach their members. They are more like tribes or even nunneries, once you have sworn yourself to a coven you are there for life, and you can’t change your mind and leave whenever you want. Depending on the Supreme, punishment for unacceptable behaviour can vary greatly.

The two ultimate punishment are death by burning and exile.

## If the Witches' Council promises to protect you, why wouldn’t you want to swear an oath to them?
They do not only protect you, they also have their own ideas and traditions that you will be expected to answer to. They can also mete out punishment against the wishes of the Supreme, or command the Coven or the Supreme to take certain actions they’d prefer not to. Most importantly they are also bound to follow the wishes of their Supreme Witch, like all Covens, what kind of Supreme is the relatively new Alessa Caito?

## Who are the Witch Hunters and are they really evil?
As long as there have been witches there have been witch hunters. Unlike witches, who can be born into any family, hunters are a family tradition. Children are trained from a young age to defend themselves from and even attack witches. 

These families usually have a long history with many stories, legends and grudges to pass on to the younger generations. They most likely stem from families that have at some point suffered an "injustice" at the hands of a witch.

So are they evil? Are witches evil? It's all a matter of perspective I'd say.
