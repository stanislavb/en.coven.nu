## History

Witches have always existed. They have always tried to keep themselves hidden and avoid discovery by the outside world. Most witches have lived in covens: a group of witches bonded together in a specific place and ruled by one witch: The Supreme. These covens have been their homes, refuge and community. 


Witch hunters have always existed as long as witches have. Under the cover of a variety of organizations they have tracked and killed witches for generations. The balance had always been pretty even, but over the last thirty years the witch hunters have succeeded in exterminating coven after coven. 

The covens that remain have gone into hiding and many witches have renounced their powers and assimilated into the rest of society. The remaining covens are mostly resigned to their fate, most witches have nowhere else to go. Even their greatest authority the Witches’ Council, seemed to have given up.


Then suddenly something changed. Witch hunters stopped focusing on covens and started hunting individual witches. At first previous coven members only, but then they started targeting anyone with magical potential. Even before many of them were aware of their own power. The Witches’ Council was forced to step in; rescuing young witches and sending them to the few covens still undiscovered by the witch hunters.


This is the situation now. Newly rescued witches arrive at a Swedish coven to discover and learn to deal with their powers, each other, and the life threatening danger they all face.

## The Dahlin Coven

Alma Dahlin built the first house in Frustunaby near the end of the seventeen hundreds. She arrived with her household and several young female wards, much to the excitement of the small community. However since the Dahlins and their wards kept mostly to themselves the rumours soon began to spread about Frustunaby being a place for pregnant young women to give birth to their unwanted bastards. It was the local church who stepped in and refuted the rumours. Afterwards the Dahlins, their wards, and their whole household would be present at church every sunday and even received several sermons dedicated to them. Generous donations had also begun to be received by the church around this time. The warm relationship between Frustunaby and the church continued even after the death of Alma and her husband.

The coven posed as many different types of retreats; schools and even an orphanage through it’s history. However it was in 1925 when the Countess Ebba von Eckermann, a former member of the Frustunaby Girls Outdoors Club, donated Frustunaby to the Girl Guides Scout Association that a permanent cover was created and remains to this day. Many other covens began to follow in their lead and it became such a popular cover that scouts terminology became part of the coven lingo. 

It wasn’t until the merging of the Girl Guides Scout Association and the Swedish Scout Association in 1960 that boys began to be allowed to join the Dahlin coven.

## The Five Powers

As the Covens died out, and witches stopped using their gifts, the powers got weaker and the two most rare powers, Pyrokinesis and Telekinesis disappeared altogether. Mortis, Vitalis, Concilium, Clairvoyance and Transferal are the remaining active powers. However the weaker versions of these powers are all that can be accessed today.

### Mortis: Touch of Death

The power to take life is a very volatile power and very hard to control. It originates from the wonder Descensum. 

Mortis requires skin to skin contact with the victim; the words "Alma, Mortis" are spoken and the victim will immediately feel their body begin to shut down as die slowly. 

Mortis manifests differently depending on the witch casting it; some can only cast it when taken over by a strong emotion, some have no control at all and cast it without intention, some can cast it at will but require more skin contact to do so. 

### Vitalis: Power of Resurrection

The power to resurrect the dead is, like Mortis, difficult to perfect and requires much practice. It originates from the wonder Vitalum Vitalis.

Vitalis doesn’t require skin to skin contact but some witches find this gives better results. The words "Alma, Vitalis" are spoken before gently blowing on the victims face. It can take a little time for the subject to regain the full function of their body after being resurrection.

Mastering Vitalis successfully is no easy feat and the side effects of being raised from the dead can be dire if it is not done correctly. Zombification, loss of speech or sight can be some of the results of an unfinished or badly executed Vitalis. Luckily it can often be corrected by more powerful Vitalis.

The after effects of being raised back from the dead can give the subject a euphoric high comparable with some drugs; this has resulted in some witches using Mortis and Vitalis on each other to get a kick. There are of course many risks. The longer the subject is dead the better the high, but a stronger witch is needed in order to resurrect fully. 

### Concilium: Mind Control

The power to control another’s mind and by extension often their body. It originates from the wonder Concilium.

Concilium varies slightly depending on the ability and strength of the witch. Eye contact with the victim is always required and the words "Alma, Concilium" are followed by instructions i.e. "Alma, Concilium. Slap yourself" or a more complex variant could be "Alma, Concilium: Go make me a cup of tea". The strength of the witch versus the strength of the victim is relevant when using Concilium, a stronger witch might be able to resist a Concilium by a weaker witch. Even a weaker witch might snap out of Concilium mid-tea brewing. Concilium might leave a victim feeling confused and disoriented or have them trapped, fully aware of their actions but unable to stop themselves. 

A good indicator that Concilium has been used is the sharp but temporary headache that often follows a longer Concilium exposure. If the victim is being exposed to Concilium repeatedly or has been under Concilium for some time this can even lead to migraines, nausea and vomiting. Prolonged use of Concilium will also have a physical effect on the witch casting it, the effect varies from witch to witch.

### Clarvoyance: Mind Reading

The power to read anothers thoughts. It originates from the wonder Clarvoyance.

Clarvoyance and Concilium have a lot of similarities; both vary slightly depending on the ability and strength of the witch and both require eye contact with the victim. Clarvoyance however is much harder to break if there is also skin contact between the witch and the victim. The words "Alma, Clarvoyance" are spoken and the victim will start speaking their thoughts aloud; sometimes they do not notice themselves doing this, sometimes they do but cannot stop themselves.

As with Concilium the strength of the witch versus the strength of the victim is relevant; a stronger witch might be able to resist or break the Clarvoyance of a weaker witch. 

### Transfero: Shifting injury to others

The power to transfer pain and injury onto others. It originates from the wonder Transmutation.

Transfero requires that the witch has eye contact with their victim throughout the Transfero and loss of eye contact breaks the Transfero, but will not undo the damage already transferred. However it is very difficult to break eye contact once Transfero. The witch establishes eye contact, says the words "Alma, Transfero" and then causes damage to their own body in some way i.e. slaps their own face or stabs a fork in their hand. The victim feels the pain in the witch's place and will also sustain the damage to their body even after the Transfero is broken. 

It is harder for a weaker witch to break the Transfero by a stronger witch, but the Transfero can be broken by a third person coming between the eye contact between the witch and their victim.

## The Seven Wonders

Every Supreme of every coven has gone through the The Seven Trials and proven themselves to be the most powerful witch in their coven: able to command all seven powers of the original powers. Only one is chosen per trial and the other candidates are eliminated round by round. It is possible to die during the trials. 

You only enter the trial once in your life, if at all. Entering the trials can be a way to speed up the revelation of your powers but it can be a high price to pay; even if you survive the trials you cease to develop anymore powers afterwards. There is no knowledge available to explain why this happens. Nor to explain why every recorded attempt of a witch to retake the trials has ended in death.

It has previously been the tradition in covens for the Supreme to invite witches from the coven to partake in The Seven Trials when it is time for a new Supreme to replace the old. These days it is not unusual for witches to volunteer themselves or even to be forced by their coven to partake.

When a new Supreme appears in a generation they begin to draw their power from the old Supreme whom begins to weaken. This is how a reigning Supreme knows when it is time to hold the trials and welcome a new, stronger Supreme. It has happened that a Supreme, unwilling to let go of their position and power has sought out the potential new Supremes and killed them before the trail can take place. This strategy is also known to be used amongst potential candidates for the trial.

## Rituals and Crystals

There exists several rituals within the coven, some of these require the use of crystals and others don’t. 

These rituals can be used to amplify a witch's powers temporarily, to create protective barriers, or to simply get a high from dangerous games such as Mortis and Vitalis. 

Each power has a crystal to represent it.
