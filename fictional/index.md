## History

Witches have always existed. They have always tried to keep themselves hidden and avoid discovery by the outside world. Most witches have lived in covens: a group of witches bonded together in a specific place and ruled by one witch: The Supreme. These covens have been their homes, refuge and community. 


Witch hunters have always existed as long as witches have. Under the cover of a variety of organizations they have tracked and killed witches for generations. The balance had always been pretty even, but over the last thirty years the witch hunters have succeeded in exterminating coven after coven. 

The covens that remain have gone into hiding and many witches have renounced their powers and assimilated into the rest of society. The remaining covens are mostly resigned to their fate, most witches have nowhere else to go. Even their greatest authority the Witches’ Council, seemed to have given up.


Then suddenly something changed. Witch hunters stopped focusing on covens and started hunting individual witches. At first previous coven members only, but then they started targeting anyone with magical potential. Even before many of them were aware of their own power. The Witches’ Council was forced to step in; rescuing young witches and sending them to the few covens still undiscovered by the witch hunters.


This is the situation now. Newly rescued witches arrive at a Swedish coven to discover and learn to deal with their powers, each other, and the life threatening danger they all face.

## The Dahlin Coven

Alma Dahlin built the first house in Frustunaby near the end of the seventeen hundreds. She arrived with her household and several young female wards, much to the excitement of the small community. However since the Dahlin’s and their wards kept mostly to themselves the rumours soon began to spread about Frustunaby being a place for pregnant young ladies to give birth to their unwanted bastards. 

It was the local church who stepped in and refuted the rumours. The Dahlin’s, their wards, and their whole household would be present at church every sunday and even received several sermons dedicated to them. Generous donations had also begun to be received by the church around this time. The close relationship between the Dahlin Coven and the local church continued even after the death of Alma and her husband.

The coven has posed as several different types of retreats; schools, and even an orphanage through its history. However it was in 1925 when the Countess Ebba von Eckermann, a former member of the Frustunaby Girls Outdoor Club, donated Frustunaby to the Girl Guides Association that a permanent cover was created and remains to this day. 
It wasn’t until the merging of the Girl Guides Association with the Swedish Scout Association in 1960 that boys began to join the Dahlin Coven.

The Dahlin Coven was like most covens today: on the brink of extinction. The numbers had dwindled dramatically over the last thirty years and new applicants had become rarer and rarer. With the death of the last Supreme four years back it was clear that no new supreme would be called until the coven regained its numbers. The sudden influx of witches from other obsolete covens over the last year was promising, and the Seven Trials was held. However it quickly became clear that no new supreme would emerge and that the trial was not valid. The coven was simply not strong enough.

## The Five Powers

As the covens began to die out, and witches stopped using their gifts, the powers got weaker over all. The two rarest powers; Pyrokinesis and Telekinesis disappeared almost all altogether. Mortis, Vitalis, Concilium, Clairvoyance and Transfero are the five powers seen in young witches today. 

Legends exist from a time when there were witches so powerful that they could burn down a forest with one look and control whole villages with their thoughts. If this is true or not is impossible to know, but that witches were once much more powerful than today is undeniable.

*Players have a lot of personal input into how they want to play on their powers and how powerful they want to be. This is something we trust you the player with. We would like to see that all players facilitate their co-players as much as possible with this. But it is always possible to avoid being bewitched and to blame this on weak powers or a sudden powerful defence. This exists so that players do not feel forced to play on things they are uncomfortable with OFF.*

### Mortis: Touch of Death

The power to take life is a volatile power and very hard to control. It originates from the power: Descensum.

Mortis requires skin to skin contact: the words “Alma, Mortis” are spoken and the victim will feel their body shut down step by step as they die. The death takes as long to complete as the skin contact remains. Meaning that you can kill slowly or quickly depending on touch.

Mortis manifests differently depending on the witch; some can only use it when taken over by a strong emotion, some have no control at all and use it without meaning to, some can use it at will but require more skin contact to do so etc.

### Vitalis: Power of Resurrection, Kiss of life, Breath of life

The power to resurrect the dead is difficult to perfect and requires practice. It originates from the power: Vitalum Vitalis.

Vitalis requires skin to skin contact: the words “Alma, Vitalis” are spoken before gently blowing life back into the victim, most often through the nose or mouth, some witches kiss instead. 

Mastering Vitalis successfully is no easy feat and the side effects of being raised from the dead can be dire if it is not done correctly. Brain damage, loss of speech, sight or use of limbs can be some of the results of an unfinished or badly executed Vitalis. Luckily it can often be corrected by more powerful Vitalis. 

Vitalis can also be used to heal wounds and repair damage to the body of the living.

One of the side effects of being raised back from the dead is the euphoric rush of life. This has resulted in some witches using Mortis and Vitalis on each other to get a kick. There are of course many risks. The longer the subject is dead the better the high may be, but strong witch is also needed complete the Vitalis. Not all trips are pleasant.

### Concilium: Mind Control

The power to control another’s mind and body. It originates from the power: Concilium.

Eye contact with the victim is always required: the words “Alma, Concilium” are followed by instructions i.e. “Alma, Concilium. Slap yourself” or a more complex variant would be “Alma, Concilium: Go make me a cup of tea”. 

The strength of the witch versus the strength of the victim is relevant when using Concilium, a stronger witch might be able to resist a Concilium by a weaker witch. Even a weaker witch might snap out of Concilium mid-tea brewing. Concilium might leave a victim feeling confused and disoriented or have them trapped, fully aware of their actions but unable to stop themselves.

A good indicator that Concilium has been used is the sharp but temporary headache that often follows a longer Concilium exposure. If the victim is being exposed to Concilium repeatedly or has been under Concilium for some time this can even lead to migraines, nausea and vomiting. 

Prolonged use of Concilium will also have a physical effect on the witch casting it. The negative side effect vary from witch to witch and can include; nosebleeds, headaches, irritability, increased hunger and fatigue.

### Clairvoyance: Mind Reading

The power to read another's thoughts. It originates from the power: Clairvoyance.

Eye contact with the victim is always required. Clairvoyance is also much harder to break if there is skin contact between the witch and the victim. The words “Alma, Clairvoyance” are spoken and the victim will start speaking their thoughts out loud; sometimes they do not notice themselves doing this, sometimes they do but cannot stop themselves.

As with Concilium the strength of the witch versus the strength of the victim is relevant; a stronger witch might be able to resist or break the Clairvoyance of a weaker witch. A weaker witch might break the spell by managing to break eye contact. 

### Transfero: Shifting injury to others

The power to transfer pain and injury onto others. It originates from the wonder Transmutation.

Transfero requires that the witch has eye contact with their victim throughout the Transfero and loss of eye contact breaks the Transfero, but will not undo the damage already transferred. However it is very difficult to break eye contact once Transfero. The witch establishes eye contact, says the words "Alma, Transfero" and then causes damage to their own body in some way i.e. slaps their own face or stabs a fork in their hand. The victim feels the pain in the witch's place and will also sustain the damage to their body even after the Transfero is broken. 

It is harder for a weaker witch to break the Transfero by a stronger witch, but the Transfero can be broken by a third person coming between the eye contact between the witch and their victim.

## The Seven Wonders

Every Supreme of every coven has gone through the The Seven Trials and proven themselves to be the most powerful witch in their coven: able to command all seven powers of the original powers. Only one is chosen per trial and the other candidates are eliminated round by round. It is possible to die during the trials. 

You only enter the trial once in your life, if at all. Entering the trials can be a way to speed up the revelation of your powers but it can be a high price to pay; even if you survive the trials you cease to develop anymore powers afterwards. There is no knowledge available to explain why this happens. Nor to explain why every recorded attempt of a witch to retake the trials has ended in death.

It has previously been the tradition in covens for the Supreme to invite witches from the coven to partake in The Seven Trials when it is time for a new Supreme to replace the old. These days it is not unusual for witches to volunteer themselves or even to be forced by their coven to partake.

When a new Supreme appears in a generation they begin to draw their power from the old Supreme whom begins to weaken. This is how a reigning Supreme knows when it is time to hold the trials and welcome a new, stronger Supreme. It has happened that a Supreme, unwilling to let go of their position and power has sought out the potential new Supremes and killed them before the trail can take place. This strategy is also known to be used amongst potential candidates for the trial.

## Rituals and Crystals

There exists several rituals within the coven, some of these require the use of crystals and others don’t. 

These rituals can be used to amplify a witch's powers temporarily, to create protective barriers, or to simply get a high from dangerous games such as Mortis and Vitalis. 

Each power has a crystal to represent it.
