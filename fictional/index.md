## History

Witches have always existed. They have always tried to keep themselves hidden and avoid discovery by the outside world. Most witches have lived in covens: a group of witches bonded together in a specific place and ruled by one witch: The Supreme Witch or Supreme for short. These covens have been their homes, refuge and community. 


Witch hunters have existed as long as witches have. Under the cover of a variety of organizations they have tracked and killed witches for generations. The balance had always been pretty even, but over the last thirty years the witch hunters have succeeded in exterminating coven after coven. 

The covens that remain have gone into hiding and many witches have renounced their powers and assimilated into the rest of society. The remaining covens are mostly resigned to their fate, most witches have nowhere else to go. Even their greatest authority the Witches’ Council, seemed to have given up.


Then suddenly something changed. Witch hunters stopped focusing on covens and started hunting individual witches. At first previous coven members only, but then they started targeting anyone with magical potential. Even before many of them were aware of their own power. The Witches’ Council was forced to step in; rescuing young witches and sending them to the few covens still undiscovered by the witch hunters.


This is the situation now. Newly rescued witches arrive at a Swedish coven to discover and learn to deal with their powers, each other, and the life threatening danger they all face.

## Hierarchy and World Structure

**The Covens** 

There are several covens around the world. They are stationary, formed in areas with a strong magical energy. This energy responds to the Coven: a large coven makes it stronger, a strong Supreme makes it stronger, strong witches make it stronger, and in turn stronger Supremes appear, and so forth. When a coven starts to die out the energy starts to wane.

A coven must consist of at least thirteen witches, less than this and a new Supreme will not appear and the coven will gradually lose its strength and die out. The Witches’ Council is a coven: it is the largest existing coven in the world. 

Other Covens you should know of are:
* Dahlin has been a Coven on the brink of extinction for several years, but once it was an influential coven with strong ties to the Council.
* Ekdal is a large prestigious Coven with close ties to the Witches’ Council. Many of its witches go on to work for the Council.
* Almsted is also a respectable Coven with loyalties to the Council.
* Holm was a smaller and rather isolated Coven. It had a long history of refusing to swear loyalty to the Council. About a year ago it was attacked and destroyed by the witch hunters.

**The Oaths** 

You are not born into a coven, you join one by swearing an oath to it. Once you’ve sworn the oath you are bound to your Coven and all its coming Supremes until your death, or the covens “death”: numbers fall under thirteen and has no Supreme. 

Witches apply to a coven by their early teens (as their powers emerge) and are trained there until they choose to take the oath, usually somewhere in their early twenties. You do not have to swear your oath to the coven that trained you, however most do.

You cannot swear an oath to two covens at the same time. The only exception being the Witches’ Council (no one knows how they can do this). Unlike the oath to your Coven, which binds you for life, the longevity of your oath to the Witches’ Council depends on who swore it. If you swore it directly to them it lasts the rest of your life, if the Supreme of your Coven swore it on behalf of the whole Coven: it last their lifetime and has to be renewed by the next Supreme.

**The Supreme Witches** 

The Supreme Witch is summoned by The Seven Trials, these can only take place on the Covens ground. The Coven is ruled by its Supreme and all the witches in the Coven must answer to their Supreme. The stronger the Supreme the stronger the rest of the Coven becomes. 

The personality of the Supreme steers the Coven: a kind Supreme nourishes its Coven and creates harmony, a nasty Supreme poisons the Coven and creates conflict. Still it would be an offence punishable by death to try to kill your Supreme, so you must simply hope for better luck next time.

There are of course limits, should a Supreme go mad and begin murdering their members the Council can be called on to help put the Supreme down. The Supreme Witch is only answerable to the Witches’ Council (if they have sworn to it). It is also generally seen as bad taste to mistreat your Coven and, since its survival relies on new witches joining it, not the smartest move.

**The Seven Trials**

Every Supreme of every coven has gone through the The Seven Trials and proven themselves to be the most powerful witch in their coven: able to command all seven of the original powers. Only one is chosen per trial and the other candidates are eliminated round by round. It is possible to die during the trials. 

You only enter the trial once in your life, if at all. Entering the trials can be a way to speed up the reveal of your powers but it can be a high price to pay; even if you survive the trials you cease to develop anymore powers afterwards. There is no available research to explain why this happens. Nor to explain why every recorded attempt of a witch to retake the trials has ended in their death.

It has previously been the tradition that the Supreme should personally select the witches that will partake in the Seven Trials. These days it is not unusual for witches to volunteer themselves or even to be forced by the other coven members to partake. If they are willing to pay the price even a junior Witch can take the Trials.

*We will ask all those interested in taking the Trials to report to us on the friday, and explain everything you'd need to know about taking part of them at that time.*

**The Witches’ Council** 

The largest and oldest recorded Coven in the world. For hundreds of years it has been the highest authority amongst the Covens. It functions as the magical communities police, legal system and army. This Coven and its Supreme are heavily guarded and its exact location in the world is kept secret. 

Its current Supreme Witch is the rather newly ordained Alessa Caito. Agents of the Council exist all over world. These agents are respected and feared as direct extensions of the will of the Council and The Supreme Witch Alessa.

It is expected that the Supremes swear an oath to the Council on behalf of their Coven. Thereby placing everyone in their Coven under the Council's protection and power. Supremes are only answerable to the Council.

The Witches’ Council can only exercise this power over those that have sworn the oath to them, and they cannot force a Supreme or any other witch to swear the oath. However most covens  traditionally do so and those that do not are often regarded with suspicion. 

## Magic 

All magic in this universe is linked to the powers present in The Seven Trials: Mortis, Vitalis, Concilium, Clairvoyance, Transfero, Telekinesis and Pyrokinesis. What that means is that as long as you can link it to one of the powers, it can be done: i.e. a ritual to load an amulet with the power of Vitalis to heal someone or protect from a deadly attack. Or maybe “curse” an object using Transfero, causing the first person to touch it to feel intense hatred or despair. 

Tarot cards, crystals, amulets, rituals etc can all be used to chanel, store, enhance or protect against magic. However the bigger the effect wanted the more tiring and time consuming to use or create: requiring preparation, patience or great strength. (Also if you do make for example, a cursed object, either inform the person you plan to use it on or leave a little note on it or something so other players know how to play on it).

You can also lend your fellow witches your strength through a ritual or chant to enhance their power: i.e. if a witch with Vitalis is too weak to heal someone, fellow witches can lend them strength to make their power strong enough. You can not “give” another witch your power though: i.e. a witch with Mortis can not lend this power to another witch that doesn’t possess it. This also means that if, say a healing ritual is being done at least one person with Vitalis must be part of it.

The LARP aims for a type or realism (with magic, yes I know), but basically try to steer clear of the fantasy magical vibe present in for example Harry Potter: no wands, no abrakadabra, no magical creatures or potions that make you swap bodies. Instead think primal rituals, chants, blood and some gore. And remember all magic has a price, whether it be a headache, a nosebleed or your soul.

*These Rituals, Chants etc do not have a right or wrong way that they can be done (we will go through ideas for them during the workshop). In game, if you want it to work it will. If you don't want it to, mess it up. Absolutely best is to communicate with the players involved OFF before hand. However as a junior: if a Senior, Second or the The Supreme tells you something isn't going to work or breaks off a ritual or spell, they are always right.* 

## The Five Powers

As the covens began to die out and more witches stopped using their gifts, the powers got weaker over all. The two rarest powers: Pyrokinesis and Telekinesis disappeared almost all altogether, only Supremes can use them after having gained them through The Seven Trials. Mortis, Vitalis, Concilium, Clairvoyance and Transfero are the five powers seen in young witches today. 

Your first power to develop is called your Primary Power. All your powers after your primary power are consecutively weaker.

Legends exist from a time when there were witches so powerful that they could burn down a forest with one look and control whole villages with their thoughts. If this is true or not is impossible to know, but that witches were once much more powerful than today is undeniable.

*Players have a lot of personal input into how they want to play on their powers and how powerful they want to be. This is something we trust you the player with. We would like to see that all players facilitate their co-players as much as possible with this. But it is always possible to avoid being bewitched and to blame this on weak powers or a sudden powerful defence. This exists so that players do not feel forced to play on things they are uncomfortable with OFF.*

### Mortis: Touch of Death

The power to take life is a volatile power and very hard to control. It originates from the power: Descensum.

Mortis requires skin to skin contact: the words “Alma, Mortis” are spoken and the victim will feel their body shut down step by step as they die. The death takes as long to complete as the skin contact remains. Meaning that you can kill slowly or quickly depending on touch.

Mortis manifests differently depending on the witch; some can only use it when taken over by a strong emotion, some have no control at all and use it without meaning to, some can use it at will but require more skin contact to do so etc.

### Vitalis: Power of Resurrection, Kiss of life, Breath of life

The power to resurrect the dead is difficult to perfect and requires practice. It originates from the power: Vitalum Vitalis.

Vitalis requires skin to skin contact: the words “Alma, Vitalis” are spoken before gently blowing life back into the victim, most often through the nose or mouth, some witches kiss instead. 

Mastering Vitalis successfully is no easy feat and the side effects of being raised from the dead can be dire if it is not done correctly. Brain damage, loss of speech, sight or use of limbs can be some of the results of an unfinished or badly executed Vitalis. Luckily it can often be corrected by more powerful Vitalis. 

Vitalis can also be used to heal wounds and repair damage to the body of the living.

One of the side effects of being raised back from the dead is the euphoric rush of life. This has resulted in some witches using Mortis and Vitalis on each other to get a kick. There are of course many risks. The longer the subject is dead the better the high may be, but strong witch is also needed complete the Vitalis. Not all trips are pleasant.

### Concilium: Mind Control

The power to control another’s mind and body. It originates from the power: Concilium.

Eye contact with the victim is always required: the words “Alma, Concilium” are followed by instructions i.e. “Alma, Concilium. Slap yourself” or a more complex variant would be “Alma, Concilium: Go make me a cup of tea”. 

The strength of the witch versus the strength of the victim is relevant when using Concilium, a stronger witch might be able to resist a Concilium by a weaker witch. Even a weaker witch might snap out of Concilium mid-tea brewing. Concilium might leave a victim feeling confused and disoriented or have them trapped, fully aware of their actions but unable to stop themselves.

A good indicator that Concilium has been used is the sharp but temporary headache that often follows a longer Concilium exposure. If the victim is being exposed to Concilium repeatedly or has been under Concilium for some time this can even lead to migraines, nausea and vomiting. 

Prolonged use of Concilium will also have a physical effect on the witch casting it. The negative side effect vary from witch to witch and can include; nosebleeds, headaches, irritability, increased hunger and fatigue.

### Clairvoyance: Mind Reading

The power to read another's thoughts. It originates from the power: Clairvoyance.

Eye contact with the victim is always required. Clairvoyance is also much harder to break if there is skin contact between the witch and the victim. The words “Alma, Clairvoyance” are spoken and the victim will start speaking their thoughts out loud; sometimes they do not notice themselves doing this, sometimes they do but cannot stop themselves.

As with Concilium the strength of the witch versus the strength of the victim is relevant; a stronger witch might be able to resist or break the Clairvoyance of a weaker witch. A weaker witch might break the spell by managing to break eye contact.  A third person can assist in breaking the eye contact between the witch and their victim.

### Transfero: Shifting injury to others

The power to transfer pain and injury onto others. It originates from the power: Transmutation. 

Transfero requires that the witch has eye contact with their victim throughout the transfer. Loss of eye contact breaks the Transfero, but will not undo the damage already transferred. However it is very difficult to break eye contact once the transferal has begun. 

The witch establishes eye contact, says the words: “Alma, Transfero” and then causes damage to their own body in some way i.e. slaps their own face or stabs a fork in their hand. The victim feels the pain in the witch’s place and will also sustain damage to their body.

It is harder for a weaker witch to break the Transfero of a stronger witch. Transfero can also be broken by a third person helping to break the eye contact between the witch and their victim.

## The Dahlin Coven

Alma Dahlin built the first house in Frustunaby near the end of the seventeen hundreds. She arrived with her household and several young female wards, much to the excitement of the small community. However since the Dahlin’s and their wards kept mostly to themselves the rumours soon began to spread about Frustunaby being a place for pregnant young ladies to give birth to their unwanted bastards. 

It was the local church who stepped in and refuted the rumours. The Dahlin’s, their wards, and their whole household would be present at church every sunday and even received several sermons dedicated to them. Generous donations had also begun to be received by the church around this time. The close relationship between the Dahlin Coven and the local church continued even after the death of Alma and her husband.

The coven has posed as several different types of retreats; schools, and even an orphanage through its history. However it was in 1925 when the Countess Ebba von Eckermann, a former member of the Frustunaby Girls Outdoor Club, donated Frustunaby to the Girl Guides Association that a permanent cover was created and remains to this day. 
It wasn’t until the merging of the Girl Guides Association with the Swedish Scout Association in 1960 that boys began to join the Dahlin Coven.

The Dahlin Coven was like most covens today: on the brink of extinction. The numbers had dwindled dramatically over the last thirty years and new applicants had become rarer and rarer. With the death of the last Supreme four years back it was clear that no new supreme would be called until the coven regained its numbers. The sudden influx of witches from other covens over the last year was promising, and the Seven Trials was held. However it quickly became clear that no new Supreme would emerge and that the trial was not valid. The coven was simply not strong enough.
