## History

Witches have always existed. They have always tried to keep themselves hidden and avoid discovery by the outside world. Most witches have lived in covens: a group of witches bonded together in a specific place and ruled by one witch: The Supreme Witch or Supreme for short. These covens have been their homes, refuge and community. 


Witch hunters have existed as long as witches have. Under the cover of a variety of organizations they have tracked and killed witches for generations. The balance had always been pretty even, but over the last thirty years the witch hunters have succeeded in exterminating coven after coven. 

The covens that remain have gone into hiding and many witches have renounced their powers and assimilated into the rest of society. The remaining covens are mostly resigned to their fate, most witches have nowhere else to go. Even their greatest authority the Witches’ Council, seemed to have given up.


Then suddenly something changed. Witch hunters stopped focusing on covens and started hunting individual witches. At first previous coven members only, but then they started targeting anyone with magical potential. Even before many of them were aware of their own power. The Witches’ Council was forced to step in; rescuing young witches and sending them to the few covens still undiscovered by the witch hunters.


This is the situation now. Newly rescued witches arrive at a Swedish coven to discover and learn to deal with their powers, each other, and the life threatening danger they all face.

## Hierarchy and World Structure

*If you are playing a junior this is not necessary information for you to know, but it can be worth skimming it to help you understand what’s going on around you more quickly during the game.*  

**The Covens**  
There are several covens around the world. They are stationary, formed in areas with a strong magical energy. This energy responds to the Coven: a large coven makes it stronger, a strong Supreme makes it stronger, strong witches make it stronger, and in turn stronger Supremes appear, and so forth. When a coven starts to die out the energy starts to wane.  

A coven must consist of at least thirteen witches, less than this and a new Supreme will not appear and the coven will gradually lose its strength and die out. The Witches’ Council is a coven: it is the largest existing coven in the world.   

Normally once your first power appears, usually in your early teens, you are sent to a coven. If you have family living within the magical community then you, or they, will probably have had a say in which coven you were sent to. Most seniors have come from families that are aware of their linage and would have expected the Council to come get you when it became clear that you were a witch. Back when witches were prevalent it wasn’t unusual for a family to contain more than one witch within the same generation. Nowadays you may only have a single distant relative in a far off coven, but they are now considered your only family. The family you had outside of the magical community are rarely seen or spoken to again. Even your parents.  

Covens are not actually schools, although they do teach their members. They are more like tribes or even nunneries, once you have sworn yourself to a coven you are there for life, and you can’t change your mind and leave whenever you want. Depending on the Supreme punishment for unacceptable behaviour in the coven can vary greatly.   

The two ultimate punishment are death by burning or exile.  

**Other Covens you should know of are:**
* **Dahlin** has been a Coven on the brink of extinction for several years, but once it was an influential coven with strong ties to the Council.
* **Ekdal** is a large prestigious Coven with close ties to the Witches’ Council. Many of its witches go on to work for the Council.
* **Almsted** is also a respectable Coven with loyalties to the Council.
* **Holm** was a smaller and rather isolated Coven. It had a long history of refusing to swear loyalty to the Council. About a year ago it was attacked and destroyed by the witch hunters.

**The Oaths**  
You are not born into a coven, you join one by swearing an oath to it. Once you’ve sworn the oath you are bound to your Coven and all its coming Supremes until your death, or the covens “death”: numbers fall under thirteen and has no Supreme.  

Having been less than thirteen, with no Supreme, the current Dahlin Coven could not swear in its newest members (from Ekdal, Almsted and Holm). This means that if the Coven had continued to dwindle, or no more witches joined it, it would have been acceptable to leave for another coven after a while.  

Witches are trained at a coven until they choose to take the oath, usually somewhere in their early twenties. You do not have to swear your oath to the coven that trained you, but most do. It is also not unusual that young witches from larger and more thriving covens are sent to smaller covens to try and revive them. As a Senior you may have been asked, ordered or volunteered to go to the Dahlin Coven.  

You cannot swear an oath to two covens at the same time. The only exception being the Witches’ Council (no one knows how they can do this). Unlike the oath to your Coven, which binds you for life, the longevity of your oath to the Witches’ Council depends on who swore it. If you swore it directly to them it lasts the rest of your life, if the Supreme of your Coven swore it on behalf of the whole Coven: it last their lifetime and has to be renewed by the next Supreme.  

*The original Dahlinians may well already have sworn the oath previously when the Coven did have Supreme, if the player wishes.*  

**The Supreme Witches**  
The Supreme Witch of a coven is selected by The Seven Trials, these can only take place on the covens ground. The coven is ruled by its Supreme and all the witches in the coven must answer to their Supreme. The stronger the Supreme the stronger the rest of the coven becomes. 

The personality of the Supreme steers the coven: a kind Supreme nourishes its coven and creates harmony, a nasty Supreme poisons the coven and creates conflict. Still it would be an offence punishable by death to try to kill your Supreme, so you must simply hope for better luck next time.

There are of course limits, should a Supreme go mad and begin murdering their members the Council can be called on to help put the Supreme down. The Supreme Witch is only answerable to the Witches’ Council (but only if they have sworn the oath). It is generally seen as bad taste to mistreat your coven and since its survival relies on new witches joining it, not the smartest move.

**The Seven Trials**  
Every Supreme of every coven has gone through the The Seven Trials and proven themselves to be the most powerful witch in their coven: able to command all seven of the Original Powers. Only one is chosen per trial and the other candidates are eliminated round by round. It is possible to die during the trials. 

You only enter the trial once in your life, if at all. Entering the trials can be a way to speed up the reveal of your powers but it can be a high price to pay; even if you survive the trials you cease to develop anymore powers afterwards. There is no available research to explain why this happens. Nor to explain why every recorded attempt of a witch to retake the trials has ended in their death.

It has previously been the tradition that the Supreme should personally select the witches that will partake in the Seven Trials. These days it is not unusual for witches to volunteer themselves or even to be forced by the other coven members to partake. If they are willing to pay the price even a junior Witch can take the Trials.

*We will ask all those interested in taking the Trials to report to us on the friday, and explain everything you'd need to know about taking part of them at that time.*

**The Witches’ Council**   
The largest and oldest recorded Coven in the world.  For hundreds of years it has been the highest authority amongst the Covens. It functions as the magical communities police, legal system and army. This Coven and its Supreme are heavily guarded, its exact location is kept secret and its agents exist all over world. Its current Supreme Witch is the recently selected Alessa Caito.

The Council does not only protect the community, they also have their own ideas and traditions that they expect their members to answer to and can mete out punishments, or give orders to Covens against the wishes of the Covens own Supreme. Most importantly they themselves are bound to follow the wishes of their own Supreme Witch, like all Covens. 

The Witches’ Council can only exercise this power over those that have sworn the oath to them, and they cannot force a Supreme or any other witch to swear the oath. However it is expected that all Supremes swear the oath to the Council on behalf of their Coven. Thereby placing everyone in their Coven under the Council's protection and power, those that do not are regarded with suspicion. 

**Family Names and Protégés**  
Having a good family name can help you get into a stronger, more prestigious or even safer coven. If you have a recognisable name it most likely means you come from a long line of prominent witches or have a famous ancestor.  

If you have no living family (within the magical community) and no strong family name, but you are proving to be a powerful witch, another family can take you in and give you their name. A popular practice with the Council. Most witches are impressed by a Protégé, since it means you are strong enough to be favoured by the Council, but it can also cause jealousy.  
## Magic 

All magic in this universe is linked to the powers present in **The Seven Trials: Descensum (Mortis), Vitalium Vitalis, Concilium, Clairvoyance, Transmutation (Transfero), Telekinesis and Pyrokinesis.** What that means is that as long as you can link it to one of the powers, it can be done: i.e. a ritual to load an amulet with the power of Vitalis to heal someone or protect from a deadly attack. Or maybe “curse” an object using Transfero, causing the first person to touch it to feel intense hatred or despair. 

Tarot cards, crystals, amulets, rituals etc can all be used to chanel, store, enhance or protect against magic. However the bigger the effect wanted the more tiring and time consuming to use or create: requiring preparation, patience or great strength. (Also if you do make for example, a cursed object, either inform the person you plan to use it on or leave a little note on it or something so other players know how to play on it).

You can also lend your fellow witches your strength through linking together (with a ritual, chant, joining hands etc): i.e. if a witch with Vitalis is too weak to heal someone, fellow witches can lend them strength to make their power strong enough. You can not “give” another witch your power though: i.e. a witch with Mortis can not lend this power to another witch that doesn’t possess it. This also means that if, say a healing ritual is being done at least one person with Vitalis must be part of it.

The LARP aims for a type or realism (with magic, yes I know), but basically try to steer clear of the fantasy magical vibe present in for example Harry Potter: no wands, no abrakadabra, no magical creatures or potions that make you swap bodies. Instead think primal rituals, chants, blood and some gore. And remember all magic has a price, whether it be a headache, a nosebleed or your soul.

*These Rituals, Chants etc do not have a right or wrong way that they can be done (we will go through ideas for them during the workshop). In game, if you want it to work it will. If you don't want it to, mess it up. Absolutely best is to communicate with the players involved OFF before hand. However as a junior: if a Senior, Second or the The Supreme tells you something isn't going to work or breaks off a ritual or spell, they are always right.* 

## The Five Powers  

As the covens began to die out and more witches stopped using their gifts, the powers got weaker over all. The two rarest powers: Pyrokinesis and Telekinesis disappeared altogether. Mortis, Vitalis, Concilium, Clairvoyance and Transfero are the five powers seen in young witches today, they are all watered down versions of the Seven Original Powers used in The Seven Trials.  

Your first power to develop is called your Primary Power. All your powers after your Primary Power are consecutively weaker. Having a power as your Primary Power means you get both its greatest advantages and its greatest disadvantages. Having a power as your second or third power means that you may have to link with other witches to reach the effects of having it as a Primary Power.  

Primary Powers are the ones that can go Rogue. Meaning that if a witch has Transfero as their Primary Power and doesn't keep complete control over it, their most private feelings might suddenly “leak out” to those around them or a Mortis witch might trigger their power accidentally when taken over by a sudden strong emotion, like happiness or love.  

Playing on your primary power going Rogue can be done but saying "Alma, [insert primary power]" without directing it at any one in particular: perhaps as you gossip with friends you accidentally use Clairvoyance, say Mortis during sex or shout Transfero when you accidentally hurt yourself. It is then up to the player/s that heard you to play on it if they wish.  

Witches who share the same Primary Power have an automatically closer connection to each other. They can more easily resist when others use their own power on them and they can more easily tell when someone else is using the same power close by.  

The powers manifests differently depending on the witch: some can only use them only when taken over by a strong emotion, some have no control at all and use them without meaning to, some can use it at will but not always to completion, etc. The more powerful the witch (with training) the more control they should have over their powers, but this may also mean that when they do lose control the result is even more damaging.  

*It is always up to the player getting the power cast on them whether they wish to play on it or not. It is always possible to opt-out of being bewitched and to blame this on weak powers or a sudden powerful defence. This exists so that players do not feel forced to play on things they are uncomfortable with OFF. For this reason: if a player doesn’t respond the first time, they may not have heard you, if they do not respond the second time they are probably choosing not to play on it. Do not say it a third time. We do however hope you all help each other out and make great scenes together.*

### Mortis: Touch of Death

Mortis is the power to take life. It comes from the Original Power: Descensum. Descensum being the decent into a hell dimension where your worst nightmares repeat endlessly, so if you kill someone with Mortis, you send them to this eternal hell. This is also a more true death than by knife or Transfero and needs a witch with Vitalis as their Primary Power to undo.  

**If it is your primary power:** You do not require skin contact to use it, but you must be visible to the person/s you are casting on. You can cast on more than one person at the same time.    

**It is known:** *A powerful enough Mortis witch can make a deal with the Gate Keeper of Descensum for a longer life in exchange for the souls of others. This make other witches a little fearful and suspicious of the Mortis witch and earned them a reputation as the witches “most likely to become evil one day”.*  

**If it is not your primary power:** It requires skin contact, you need to link with more witches to cast as if it was a Primary Power.  

**How to use it:** The words “Alma, Mortis” are spoken and the victim will feel their body shut down step by step as they die. You can describe the process of their death to the player i.e. “you can feel your heart rate slow down and your breathing becoming harder…” or you can hold up your hand as a counter to show them how close to their death they are (counting down with your fingers, so five is alive and zero is dead). You can also combine these methods. 

It is possible to be too weak to complete the Mortis: leaving the victim on the brink of death, or for a powerful witch to purposely do so as a form of torture. The damage to the organs caused by the Mortis remain after the witch has stopped casting. Depending on how close to death the victim is the more powerful Vitalis is needed to heal them.

### Vitalis: Power of Resurrection

The power to resurrect the dead is difficult to perfect and requires practice. It originates from the power: Vitalum Vitalis.

Vitalis requires skin to skin contact: the words “Alma, Vitalis” are spoken before gently blowing life back into the victim, most often through the nose or mouth, some witches kiss instead. 

Mastering Vitalis successfully is no easy feat and the side effects of being raised from the dead can be dire if it is not done correctly. Brain damage, loss of speech, sight or use of limbs can be some of the results of an unfinished or badly executed Vitalis. Luckily it can often be corrected by more powerful Vitalis. 

Vitalis can also be used to heal wounds and repair damage to the body of the living.

One of the side effects of being raised back from the dead is the euphoric rush of life. This has resulted in some witches using Mortis and Vitalis on each other to get a kick. There are of course many risks. The longer the subject is dead the better the high may be, but strong witch is also needed complete the Vitalis. Not all trips are pleasant.

### Concilium: Mind Control

The power to control another’s mind and body. It originates from the power: Concilium.

Eye contact with the victim is always required: the words “Alma, Concilium” are followed by instructions i.e. “Alma, Concilium. Slap yourself” or a more complex variant would be “Alma, Concilium: Go make me a cup of tea”. 

The strength of the witch versus the strength of the victim is relevant when using Concilium, a stronger witch might be able to resist a Concilium by a weaker witch. Even a weaker witch might snap out of Concilium mid-tea brewing. Concilium might leave a victim feeling confused and disoriented or have them trapped, fully aware of their actions but unable to stop themselves.

A good indicator that Concilium has been used is the sharp but temporary headache that often follows a longer Concilium exposure. If the victim is being exposed to Concilium repeatedly or has been under Concilium for some time this can even lead to migraines, nausea and vomiting. 

Prolonged use of Concilium will also have a physical effect on the witch casting it. The negative side effect vary from witch to witch and can include; nosebleeds, headaches, irritability, increased hunger and fatigue.

### Clairvoyance: Mind Reading

The power to read another's thoughts. It originates from the power: Clairvoyance.

Eye contact with the victim is always required. Clairvoyance is also much harder to break if there is skin contact between the witch and the victim. The words “Alma, Clairvoyance” are spoken and the victim will start speaking their thoughts out loud; sometimes they do not notice themselves doing this, sometimes they do but cannot stop themselves.

As with Concilium the strength of the witch versus the strength of the victim is relevant; a stronger witch might be able to resist or break the Clairvoyance of a weaker witch. A weaker witch might break the spell by managing to break eye contact.  A third person can assist in breaking the eye contact between the witch and their victim.

### Transfero: Shifting injury to others

The power to transfer pain and injury onto others. It originates from the power: Transmutation. 

Transfero requires that the witch has eye contact with their victim throughout the transfer. Loss of eye contact breaks the Transfero, but will not undo the damage already transferred. However it is very difficult to break eye contact once the transferal has begun. 

The witch establishes eye contact, says the words: “Alma, Transfero” and then causes damage to their own body in some way i.e. slaps their own face or stabs a fork in their hand. The victim feels the pain in the witch’s place and will also sustain damage to their body.

It is harder for a weaker witch to break the Transfero of a stronger witch. Transfero can also be broken by a third person helping to break the eye contact between the witch and their victim.

## The Dahlin Coven

Alma Dahlin built the first house in Frustunaby near the end of the seventeen hundreds. She arrived with her household and several young female wards, much to the excitement of the small community. However since the Dahlin’s and their wards kept mostly to themselves the rumours soon began to spread about Frustunaby being a place for pregnant young ladies to give birth to their unwanted bastards. 

It was the local church who stepped in and refuted the rumours. The Dahlin’s, their wards, and their whole household would be present at church every sunday and even received several sermons dedicated to them. Generous donations had also begun to be received by the church around this time. The close relationship between the Dahlin Coven and the local church continued even after the death of Alma and her husband.

The coven has posed as several different types of retreats; schools, and even an orphanage through its history. However it was in 1925 when the Countess Ebba von Eckermann, a former member of the Frustunaby Girls Outdoor Club, donated Frustunaby to the Girl Guides Association that a permanent cover was created and remains to this day. 
It wasn’t until the merging of the Girl Guides Association with the Swedish Scout Association in 1960 that boys began to join the Dahlin Coven.

The Dahlin Coven was like most covens today: on the brink of extinction. The numbers had dwindled dramatically over the last thirty years and new applicants had become rarer and rarer. With the death of the last Supreme four years back it was clear that no new supreme would be called until the coven regained its numbers. The sudden influx of witches from other covens over the last year was promising, and the Seven Trials was held. However it quickly became clear that no new Supreme would emerge and that the trial was not valid. The coven was simply not strong enough.
